# HTML with emojis to base64 converter

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to convert emojis in an HTML file to base64 images. 

## Background

The creator of this tool had a cron job that sent an HTML file with emojis to their HP printer's email address for daily printing. However, the printer could not print emojis and instead printed empty boxes. 

This is where this tool comes in - it converts the emojis in the HTML file to base64 images, making them printable on the HP printer.

## Usage

Using the tool is simple. Open `index.html` and select the HTML file you want to convert using the dropdown. Once the file is selected, all emojis in the file will be converted to base64 images.

## Notes

- This tool was designed for a specific use case and may have limited functionality beyond its intended purpose.
- The tool was tested only on an HTML file generated from Google Docs and may not work with other HTML files.
- No bug fixes or maintenance support beyond its initial creation are provided with this tool.
